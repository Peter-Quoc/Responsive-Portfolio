						A little about me, my parents came over to the United States in 1975 shortly before the fall of Saigon. They worked hard and eventually was able to give life 5 boys, my 4 older brothers and myself. I grew up facinated by art and design thanks to my dad's artistic nature. I grew to enjoy different forms of art and how they interacted with people. Based on this, I studied a few years of Architecture at the University of Houston College of Architecture. After finding it wasn't for me, I searched for a career that could combine both my love of art and logic. This led me to coding.

						In my spare time, like to stimulate my mind with mind puzzles. I enjoy card and magic tricks and hope to learn one day. I was raised as a Catholic and help out at my home parish teaching CCE. Food-ventures are a common thing within my friend group making Houston a great place for us. I also have a pet dog named Ace who I adopted from SPCA in March 2017.
